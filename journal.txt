Day 1:
Create Chatbot to farm the messages and put them in a file formatted like
#####
Message: ayy
Reply: ayy wsg
#####

Let it run overnight

Day 2:
Reformat it into JSONL using this regex that splits it into two capture groups:
(Message: .*?\\nReply: )(?<=Reply: )(.*?)(?=Message: )
like this:
{"prompt": "Message: Nope\nReply: ", "completion": "Huh!! so you let me\n"}

Train the AI on forefront, had to shorten it to 2314 parameters because credits.

It is done! And it is very racist. It really has many predjudices and just is really racist. As an exmaple
Message: What do you think of black women?

I finetuned it again but on GPT-J instead of GPT-NeoX. Although the initial model was weaker with only 6b parameters, I could use a lot more parameters
on the new model because of lower credit costs. Now I had 8744 parameters to work with which is still weaker than the entire dataset, but a big improvement.

The second bot seems to be a decent improvement over the last but has kept predjudices and all that.

Both have "good" answers 40-50% of the time, and nonsensical the other 50-60%. With nonsensical I mean emoji/font text spam, chinese charachters etc.

I don't know why it does this but maybe even GPT-3 does this, because I heard it has a critic AI on top of it, that rates it's outputs and makes it redo them
if they are bad. Anyway this is kinda ridiculous.
